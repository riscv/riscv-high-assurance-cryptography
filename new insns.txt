You do not need to pass "size" to h.init/setup/open BUT you need to know it in order to create a 
context and it is implied.

":vsetvl N
1: vl vd
   sub x2, x2, vl
   bne vl, x2, 1"-like sequence
   
h.seal  hN, v  // after h.init/state/.open this will always succeed. If algorithm has multiple shares, this will also generate them

h.seal after an import will verify

h.finalize (pseudo h.seal, but aften an export) will generate a tag.


h.import
+ need to store the auth tag to verify in a vector register.

h.export
+ need to give a vector register to store the auth tag


h.exec
h.state // steps in a more complex algorithm


h.size xM, hN // tells us how many bytes we need to store a context
