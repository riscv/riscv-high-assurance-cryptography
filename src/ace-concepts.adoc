=== Concepts

The core concept of ACE is the _Cryptographic Context_ (CC), an architectural container for managing cryptographic material and its associated metadata.
A CC contains two blocks of information: _metadata_ and _content_.
The metadata specifies the cryptographic algorithm and optional usage policies, while the content holds sensitive material such as keys, other secrets, and other internal state used by the algorithm specified in the metadata.
The architecture ensures the integrity of a CC by permitting modifications only through defined architectural mechanisms and following rules determined by the configured cryptographic algorithm.

CC content is accessible only to the ACE implementation.
To protect material outside of the architectural state, a CC may be exported as a _Sealed Cryptographic Context_ (SCC), which can be later reimported into a CC.
An SCC is an encrypted and authenticated data package comprising the metadata, a nonce, a tag, and the encrypted content.
Export and import operations utilize a _Context Transport Key_ (CTK), which is stored in a Machine Mode-only register.
Machine Mode is responsible for managing the CTK, unless the latter is hardwired or ephemerally generated by hardware.

Keys residing within a CC or SCC are termed _opaque_.

ACE can bind an opaque key to a _Locale_, representing a specific device, hardware configuration, or boot cycle, by using a _Locale CTK_ derived from the CTK.
The Locale CTK is derived from the CTK and a locale-specific secret via a key derivation function.
The system maintains a table of locale-specific secrets.
