[.red]#Put here the definitions of CCs, SCCs, opaque keys, Locales.#

A CC contains two blocks of information: the *metadata* and the *content*:

* The metadata is (mostly) algorithm independent and architected.

What happens when a CC is accessed and it hasn't been created in the CC
memory?

Can allocated CCs be used with non-contiguous IDs?

Should we define an architected minimum size for the CC memory? I'd say yes to guarantee that the same code is guaranteed to work in minimal ACE implementations.
