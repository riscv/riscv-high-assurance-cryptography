During the last few weeks, the ACE (Atomic Cryptography Extension) specification has significantly grown.  We recall that "ACE defines an interface to high-performance cryptographic operations without giving software access to the keys. [...]  [it] restricts the use of the secret material to a specific algorithm, and may optionally enforce usage constraints based on the process, VM, security state, boot cycle, or other policies. An expiration date mechanism is defined as well, to invalidate a key at a specific time."

Think of it as KeyLocker (intel) or Protected-Key (IBM) but "done better". For instance, we could add many new algorithms and would not need to define new instructions. And we hide not only the keys, but also critical intermediate values.

We have now achieved better clarity into how isolation of keys according to processes and modes would work, we have a single metadata format that is extraordinarily compact (64 bits) and allows for implementation-specific additional data blocks, an expiration date, more Localities, where more than one can be active at the same time, and even speed improvements to import/export of Cryptographic Registers (the containers that protect keys) in some cases. More modes of operation have been defined, and there is a sketch of how elliptic curve based algorithms would work. In the near future I will add examples for ML-KEM and ML-DSA, but I need to focus on other things for the moment.

## What's Changed
**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-high-assurance-cryptography/compare/v0.2.14...ace-0.3.1

* NEW STRUCTURE WITH SEPARATE CHAPTERS FOR UNPRIV, PRIV ARCHS AND EXAMPLES, ANNEXES
* Changed K[Xn] notation to K(Xn) to better resemble the RISC-V SAIL notation
* Added GCM with pre-set IV
* Remove filter CSRs and update usage control annex
* Significant updates to Localities
** Added SW isolation Localities
** Added the ability to put several Localities together
** Use the Localities as prefixed to the AES-GCM-SIV method for export/import, thus eliminating the need for derived CSKs.
* Metadata is now defined as ONLY a 64-bit header, no multiple formats in this version of the specification
* Clarified replacement sequences
* Removed `ace.derive` since we do not use it.
* Remove redundant `CR.importing` state from import algorithm
* Added HMAC
* Add gen_rnd_scalar state to ECC algorithms
* Add `ace.clone`, `ace.avail`, `ace.restrict` to `Zlv` and `Zlio` requirements
* Minor changes to `crdirty`.
* MANY typos and style things.
