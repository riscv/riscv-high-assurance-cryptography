== Pseudocode Notation

* `0` denotes a single bit equal to zero.
* `1` denotes a single bit equal to one.
* `bin(n,m)` = binary representation of `n` to `m` bits (`m` least significant bits, or sign extended).
* `Galoismul(a, b)` = multiplication of `a` and `b` in an finite field implied by the context.
* `len_in_bits(M)` = length of `M` in bits.
* `len_in_bytes(M)` = length of `M` in bytes.
* `lsb(x)` = least significant bit of `x`.
* `m[i .. j]` = bytes from the ``i``-th to the ``j``-th of byte array ``m``.
* `m[j:i]` = bit-slice from the ``i``-th to the ``j``-th bit of ``m``.
* `Montmul(a, b)` = Montgomery multiplication of `a` and `b` in a ring implied by the context.
* `msb(x)` = most significant bit of `x`.
* `ones(i)` = sequence of `i` ones.
* `zeros(i)` = sequence of `i` zeros.
